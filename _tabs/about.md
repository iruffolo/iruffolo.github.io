I am a computer science PhD student at the University of Toronto supervised by 
Alex Mariakakis who leads the Computational Health and Interaction (CHAI) lab, 
and Mike Brudno who leads the DATA team at UHN.

My main research interest is in applying ML to healthcare, with a focus on
alarm management and how to apply ML safely in the clinic.
